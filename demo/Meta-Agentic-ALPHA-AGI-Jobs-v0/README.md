# Meta-Agentic ALPHA AGI Jobs v0

This directory contains the initial scaffolding for the Meta-Agentic ALPHA AGI Jobs demo environment. It currently exposes a lightweight layout that can be extended with configuration, scripts, and sample datasets as development progresses.

## Structure

- `config/` – Placeholder for environment and agent configuration files.
- `scripts/` – Placeholder for orchestration or data preparation scripts.
- `data/` – Placeholder for example datasets or fixtures.

Each folder currently includes a short README placeholder so the empty directories remain tracked until populated with real content and so future contributors know where to drop their files.
